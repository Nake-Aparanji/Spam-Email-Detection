Brief Description of the Project -
My project is divided into 2 parts: (a) Using Count Vectorizer as the vectorization technique and implementing all the stated Machine Learning algorithms without any hyperparameter tuning, meaning, keeping it as simple as possible. (b) Using TF-IDF Vectorization as the vectorization technique and implementing the Machine Learning algorithms along with hyper parameter tuning, along with the additional Ensemble Technique, thus making it more complex. The results for both implementations are later displayed at the end. The following sections will delve deeper into the solution, results, and insights gained from the project.
